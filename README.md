### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
I am Vassil Atanassov, a MSc Robotics student at TU Delft in the Netherlands.

- I am currently at the end of my first year.
- My main interests are in agile legged locomotion through model-based + data-driven control.
- Most of the repos you can see here are part of my course work, mostly focused on Dynamics and Control, in addition to some Deep Learning.


Complete projects:


- [Safe Model Predictive Control](https://github.com/Vassil17/Safe_Nonholonomic_MPC), [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYDxWkKvzZ8):

Our project For the Model Predictive Control course at TU Delft, where we use a decentralised MPC approach for multiple robots to track a desired trajectory, while avoiding each other when their paths cross.
